**A brand new update. \[*status: in developing*\]**

This project was made fundamentally for the Russian audience.
## TODO
~~A list has been moved. A list is now available via this link: https://github.com/openvk/openvk/projects/1?fullscreen=true~~

Unfortunately, a list has moved again, and ordinary people can't access it now. An archive list is still open by the link above, but it will not be updated.
